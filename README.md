## General Information
- A classic local multiplayer game of tic tac toe. It is a fun quickplay game for Batman and Superman fans as it is themed around the idea of Batman vs Superman.
- Why did you undertake it? Just a fun game to create. At the time I learned how to
create a mobile application and so I decided to apply those skills in some way like
creating a simple tic tac toe game.

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Has a home window where both players can enter their usernames to play the game

- Transition from game window to the result window where it would conclude if Batman won, Superman won or if it ended in a draw.


## Screenshots
I have not uploaded any screenshots of this app due to copyright issues. At that time, I used some images of Batman and Superman from google to create this game. Hence, I have not uploaded any images with regards to this application.
